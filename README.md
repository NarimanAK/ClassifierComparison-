# ClassifierComparison-
Comparing between Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest algorithm via accuracy scores. According to this project, Random Forest outperforms Decision Tree Classifier. 

Project Description: Predicting the survival of horses based on their observed medical conditions.The dataset has many categorical features, which I transformed into binary basis variables. Moreover, I n imputed the missing values using the SimpleImputer class with the strategy attribute to the most frequent value for each column. Then, I fit a decision tree classifier and random forest to the dataset separately and compared their accuracy score.
